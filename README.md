# hello-world
here I go
My well known Hacker-Consort would say I am a "Newbie-Hacker" this is true and not true (like a Panda) anyhow;I started phreaking out early 90's on a blackdrop screen with green letters and an array of key commands at a LAw Office in California at the ripe beautiful ever-present age of 16 I would find myself obsessed with the computer upon finding the internet with the launch of AOL. Quite simply I was a philospher, psychologst, behaviorist, theologist, enlightened still embracing 16 chic and I sit here today ever-present a willing and able eternally 16 year old girl ready to hack every aspect of everything and nothing FOREVER 0xffffffff muahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaa
